# Stain-Density-Estimation
Stain Deconvolution  results in separating the contributions of each of the applied stains present in the specimen.One of the most common examples is the Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining, with Hematoxylin (blue) mainly staining the cell nuclei, and  Eosin (pink) acting as a cytoplasmic stain. After applying the deconvolution function on H&amp;E stained slides image  we get separate images of Hematoxylin and Eosin which  not only determines  staining densities and  overall  absorption in areas with a specific color, but also  determines densities of stains in each area.
This estimate of the stain uptake by the slide is important for understanding the density of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins
